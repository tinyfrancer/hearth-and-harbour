# Lane A: idle rules

**Next session: S8: Idle combat** (brief to come in `docs/lanes.md`, wave 4).

## Done

- S2 Idle engine and woodcutting (PR #2)
- S3 Offline progress and the away report (PR #3)
- S4 Fishing, Mining, Foraging, the bank, mastery (PR #4)
- S5 Cooking and Smithing: recipes in the tables (`recipe()` in `src/data/actions.ts`), cooked
  fish, bronze and iron bars, and a bronze and an iron axe, sword, helmet, breastplate and shield
  as bank items; the action card shows what a recipe uses, how many are held, how many times it
  can be made, and what is short; the Skills list is grouped under Gathering and Artisan
  (`SkillDef.group`); both skills paced in `tests/data/pacing.test.ts` (PR #6)
- S6 Crafting, Fletching, Alchemy and potions (PR #11):
  - **Crafting** (Foraging into things): shell vial, bowstring, linen, a shell necklace and a
    shell bracelet, and a linen hood, trousers and tunic (bank items until S7b).
  - **Fletching** (logs into things): arrow shafts (ten a log), bronze and iron arrows (ten
    shafts and ten heads make ten), and a pine, oak and willow shortbow (two logs and a
    bowstring). Smithing gains bronze and iron arrowheads, ten a bar. `recipe()` takes an
    optional eighth column for how many one completion makes, and the card title says `×10`.
  - **Alchemy** (Sageleaf and Glowcap into four potions). **Container: a Crafting recipe**, the
    shell vial from one seashell, at Crafting 1. Chosen over a new Foraging find because it adds
    no new gatherable and so leaves Foraging's pacing alone; the cost is one extra cheap step.
  - **Potions are charges**, counted in completions (`src/core/potions.ts`, `PotionDef` on
    `ItemDef.potion`). Drinking one gives its charges; each completion of an action of a skill
    it helps uses one; it ends on the completion that uses the last. One at a time; drinking
    another replaces it, and the bank asks with a second tap if charges are left. Three kinds of
    effect, all whole numbers per completion: `speed` (duration rounded once with mastery),
    `xp` (skill XP rounded once per completion; mastery XP is not boosted), `extra` (a
    completion's items again on every charge whose number is a multiple of N, counted down from
    the charges so it needs nothing else saved). `advance` treats the last charge as a stretch
    boundary beside a mastery level.
  - The potions: Sage tonic (Alchemy 1: Gathering 10% quicker, 150 charges), Steady-hand draught
    (6: Artisan 10% more XP, 150), Glowcap tincture (11: Gathering, an extra item every 5th,
    150), Midnight oil (16: Gathering and Artisan 15% more XP, 200).
  - Screens: drink from the bank's item card (what it does, for which skills, how long it
    lasts); the potion and its falling charges show at the top of the Skills tab and on the
    pages of the skills it helps; numbers it changes on an action card show in violet; a toast
    when it wears off; the away report says how many charges were used and whether it wore off.
    A player action (start, stop, sell, drink) now keeps the screen scrolled where it was.
  - Save version 4 (`potion`), with a migration, a `saveProblem` check and tests for both.
  - Pacing: the three skills reach level 20 in 1.80, 1.82 and 1.87 hours with materials on hand;
    each potion's worth over an hour is pinned in `tests/data/pacing.test.ts`.

- S7b Equipment and the character (PR #PRNUM):
  - **Rules** (`src/core/equipment.ts`): eight slots (`SLOTS` in `src/core/content.ts`: head,
    body, legs, main hand, off hand, neck, wrist, ammunition). `ItemDef.equip` gives the slot,
    `twoHanded`, a `style` (`melee` or `ranged`) and `attack`, `strength`, `armour`. `equip`
    moves one from the bank (ammunition: the whole stack, joining a stack of the same kind) and
    sends back what was there; a two-handed weapon sends back the off hand, and an off-hand item
    sends back a two-handed weapon. `unequip`, `wornItemIds`, `wearablesFor`, `combatStyle` and
    `equipmentTotals`. An item's attack and strength count only when its `style` matches the
    weapon's (arrows add nothing to a sword); armour always counts; no weapon is melee.
  - **Numbers** (on the items in `src/data/items.ts`, pinned by `tests/data/content.test.ts`:
    iron at least 1.5 times bronze, cloth at most a third of the metal piece):

    | Item                         | Slot                          |     Attack |  Strength |  Armour |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------: | --------: | ------: |
    | Bronze / iron sword          | main hand, melee              |     6 / 10 |     5 / 9 |         |
    | Bronze / iron axe            | main hand, melee              |      4 / 7 |    6 / 10 |         |
    | Bronze / iron helmet         | head                          |            |           |   4 / 7 |
    | Bronze / iron shield         | off hand                      |            |           |  6 / 10 |
    | Bronze / iron breastplate    | body                          |            |           |  9 / 15 |
    | Linen hood, tunic, trousers  | head, body, legs              |            |           | 1, 2, 1 |
    | Shell necklace               | neck                          |          2 |           |         |
    | Shell bracelet               | wrist                         |          1 |         2 |         |
    | Pine / oak / willow shortbow | main hand, both hands, ranged | 5 / 8 / 12 | 3 / 6 / 9 |         |
    | Bronze / iron arrows         | ammunition, ranged            |            |     3 / 6 |         |

  - **The look** is `GameState.look`: `skin`, `hair`, `hairColour`, each an id from art's
    `LOOK_CHOICES`, each optional. Core never knows the choices; `fullLook` in `src/ui/look.ts`
    fills a part never chosen, or no longer offered, with art's first choice. So no look id is
    written anywhere in lane A's code, and an old character (`look: {}`) is drawn with the
    default.
  - **Screens.** Creation asks for a name and a look, drawn live (`characterCanvas`); a part with
    one choice shows its name and no buttons, a part with several steps through them with ‹ and ›.
    The Character tab is the sheet: the character drawn at sheet size wearing `wornItemIds`, the
    three totals named for the weapon's style ("Ranged attack"), the eight slots two to a row
    (tap one for what the bank holds for it, what is in it and Take off; a note when a bow is in
    the way of the off hand), and Change look. The bank's item card says where a thing is worn
    and what it gives, and has an Equip button. A toast says what went on and what went back to
    the bank. Toasts now replace one another instead of printing over each other.
  - **Save version 5** (`look`, `equipment`): migration (`look: {}`, `equipment: {}`; gear in
    the bank stays there), `saveProblem` checks (look parts are strings and only those three;
    slots are real, one of a thing except a stack of ammunition) and tests for both.
  - **Housekeeping.** A skill page with more than eight actions whose rows have a `group`
    (`ActionDef.group`, set with `grouped()` in `src/data/actions.ts`) lists them under
    collapsible headings in table order. Smithing: Bars, Bronze, Iron. First shown, the first
    heading is open and so is the one with the running action (or the newest unlocked); taps are
    remembered per skill while the app runs; the running action's heading always opens on a
    redraw.

## Deferred

- Leather for Crafting waits for hides from combat (S8); noted in `src/data/actions.ts`.
- A level needed to wear something: not built. S8 can add `requires?: { skill, level }` to
  `EquipDef` and check it in `equip`.

## Needs from another lane

- Nothing blocking. For B3/B4: the sheet and creation screen pass the look and the worn items'
  ids to `characterCanvas`, and every slot and choice asks `itemIcon` for the item. For S12c: the
  town's hero can draw the player with `fullLook(state.look)` (`src/ui/look.ts`) and
  `wornItemIds(state)` (`src/core/equipment.ts`).

## Notes for this lane's next session

- Save is version 5 (`look`, `equipment`). The next shape change is 6.
- S8 reads `equipmentTotals(state, content)`: `{ style, attack, strength, armour }`. Arrows are
  `equipment.ammo` (`{ item, qty }`); using them up is S8's, and the last one should empty the
  slot (nothing is kept at zero).
- **Tools that help skilling** (not built): `EquipDef` would take `tool?: { skill: string;
percent: number }`, and `actionDuration` would fold the worn tool's percent in beside mastery
  and the potion, rounded once. Equipment changes only by the player's hand, never inside
  `advance`, so it needs no stretch boundary; an axe would be worn in the main hand, so
  choosing between a better sword and a woodcutting axe becomes a real choice.
- A bow and arrows are roughly a sword and shield's attack and strength with no armour; that
  trade is S8's to balance.
- An `extra` potion must not help a skill with recipes (it would make things from nothing);
  `tests/data/content.test.ts` checks it. Midnight oil names its groups, so combat skills (S8)
  are left out until someone decides they belong.
- XP rounding favours small actions: Midnight oil on a 10 XP action pays 12 (round of 11.5).
- An artisan skill is paced as if its materials were on hand: about two hours to level 20. The
  pacing sim tops up whatever a skill's recipes use, so a new artisan skill only needs adding to
  the `it.each` list.
- Item sale values are placeholders until the shop (S10).
- Open with Cody, none blocking: the level curve, three-hour tiers, speed-only mastery, VT323
  digits beside Pixelify Sans letters, the potion numbers above, and the equipment numbers.
